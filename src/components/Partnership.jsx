            The positive and negative animal welfare status are 
            influenced by many factors including: social, cultural, 
            religious, economic status, livelihoods levels, poverty, 
            effluence, level of education, emotions, awareness on the 
            subject matter, security and pubic order, politics and 
            management of society among others. With this severe 
            situation; it is worse when indicators show that even 
            the van guards of animal welfare (the veterinary personnel) 
            may also not grasp the animal welfare subject matter 
            well and its practical application.
            Furthermore – many reforms have taken place in the 
            delivery of veterinary services in Africa in the 
            recent past culminated in broken down and dwindled 
            resource envelop thus weakening of the veterinary services. 
            Such reforms have created a gap in providing services in an 
            area considered as still obscure and yet very important 
            and the basis for sustainable animal health services i.e. 
            the animal welfare. Public services do not have adequate 
            capacity to address this gap which is better covered by 
            civil society as recommended by the National Agricultural 
            Policy (NAP) 2013. The above grave status on animal welfare 
            justifies need to form multi-sector partnerships to deliver 
            services this gap area. Since the Animal Welfare and 
            Protection Organization (AWPO) has been formed to champion 
            a crusade to make the public more kind to animals – 
            requires partnerships with public services – private – 
            other civil society (PPP) from within Uganda, at Eastern 
            and Central African Regional Level, at African 
            Continental Level and Globally.
