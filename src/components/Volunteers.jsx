                Welfare and Protection Organization (AWPO) because of the 
                give nature and charity based services where inadequate 
                funding and inadequate technical personnel are available.

                services to communities inform of: awareness creation; 
                education – training – skills sharpening and improving 
                competencies for the various stakeholders downstream along 
                the entire livestock value chain. Volunteers can be

                engaged by the Organization are required in the above 
                field to improve their professional proficiency.
